# mysql

## This is a project aimed to facilitate mass-creation of diplomas.

1. Text information is extracted from MySQL database (I'm using MySQL Workbench to import .cvs files into it)
2. Background images and fonts are included.
4. libharu is used to create final .pdf files.

*This is a Linux project, compiling with gcc. All the libraries are not included as of yet*.
